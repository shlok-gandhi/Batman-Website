		<h1>Why is Batman Batman?</h1>
		<p id="by">Published by Robin</p>
		Batman is an expert in interrogation techniques and his intimidating and frightening appearance alone 		is often all that is needed in getting information from suspects. Despite having the potential to 			harm his enemies, Batman's most defining characteristic is his strong commitment to justice 				and his reluctance to take a life.

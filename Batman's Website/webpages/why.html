			<h1><b>The Bat Cave</b></h1>
			Bob Kane, who was on the movie set, mentioned this to Bill Finger who was going to be the 			initial scripter on the Batman daily newspaper strip. Finger included with his script a 			clipping from Popular Mechanics that featured a detailed cross section of underground 			hangars. Kane used this clipping as a guide, adding a study, crime lab, workshop, hangar and 			garage. This illustration appeared in the Batman "dailies" on October 29, 1943 in a strip 			entitled "The Bat Cave!"
